          <h3>C.P.A Crypto Tax Specialist</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Christopher P. Anderson (C.P.A.), a crypto tax specialist that wants to help YOU get the biggest tax return that you're entitled to. Many people who have made a lot of money using crypto over the past year think that they can do their taxes by themselves. But this is WRONG. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants to take as much of your hard earned money as it possibly can, and will use any available legal "loop holes" to do it! If you're looking to save money on your next tax bill, then you've come to the right place. Christopher P. Anderson (C.P.A.) has been a crypto tax specialist for over 15 years, and is widely regarded as one of the foremost tax professionals in the crypto industry.</p>

            <p class="large">If the idea of a Big Government financial audit is keeping you up at night, then the choice is clear: You need professional tax help. <span class="link">http://cryptotaxspecialist.0ms.co</span></p>

        <h3>Seeking common-sense advice for passive retirement income</h3>
        <p>Hello. My name is Raymond and I am seeking common-sense advice for passive retirement income. I have a small but modest portfolio that i have been growing for many years now. But I still don't think it is enough to retire on. I have been told that investors with very low risk tolerances, such as myself, should invest in a diversified portfolio of fixed income. But with high inflation as high as it is, my grandson has suggested that I look into investing in crypto-currencies. He is very smart, and I trust his opinion a great deal. However, I don't understand the first thing about crypto-currencies, and I don't even know where to get started. With all of that being said, I would like to hire a financial advisor who is familiar with crypto-currencies to help me get started. I don't need anything fancy. I just want the basic package</p>
        <p>If this description matches your speciality, then please send an e-mail to raymondfranklin1944@hotmail.com</p>
