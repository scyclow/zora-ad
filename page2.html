        <h3>HELP</h3>
        <p>I recently purchased the Samsung Smart Refrigerator, which has the new crypto wallet-sync feature. Normally this feature is quite convenient! My former roommate has this exact same refrigerator at his new apartment, and whenever he runs out of eggs the device will flawlessly submit a delivery order for a new carton, withdrawing the funds directly from his wallet. He doesn't even need to think about it.</p>

        <p>This feature has not worked quite so flawlessly with me. I attempted to set up the device by scanning the QR code on the screen and syncing my wallet. But when I checked my wallet later, all of my ETH was gone! I had 137.82 ETH in that wallet, which is now completely inaccessible because of some stupid glitch!</p>

        <p>I'm not 100% sure what happened, but I did some research and came across a thread from someone who had the exact same issue. Someone responded that the device has it's own internal wallet, which makes payments directly to vendors. And sometimes during setup the transaction data gets corrupted and it will transfer the full contents of the sending wallet to this internal temporary wallet.</p>

        <p>Needless to say, I'm very upset! The majority of my money is in crypto, which means that my refrigerator now has a higher net worth than I do. </p>

        <p>If you have experience with Web3-connected refrigerators, please contact me! I'm very privacy-conscious, and I'm a bit uncomfortable putting my personal details in print. So please contact the editors of this publication for contact information.</p>

          <h3>The Democrats are making me sick to my stomach with this new legislation</h3>
          <p>I jsut read an article on <span class="link">http://fakebullshit.news</span> that's really makin my blood boil and i need to get it off my chest. Those damn Demon-rats keep screwing over hard working Americans like myself who just want to earn an honest buck and if that honest buck comes from cryptocurrencies then they can't wait to get their greedy little hands on it. they just CAN'T STAND to have people making money on completely sovereign currencies outside their jurisdiction and they're willing to do everything in their power to unconsitutionally TAX IT. True Patriots need to STAND UP TO BIG GOVEERNMENT tryinf to steal our hard earned money! Otherwise we're no better than Socialist Europe or China.</p>
